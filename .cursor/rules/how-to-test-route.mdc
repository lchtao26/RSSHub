# Testing Routes in RSSHub

## Identifying the Route
1. Ask the user which route they want to test if not specified
2. Users may provide either a route file or a route path
3. When given a route file, examine its content to find the test path (typically in the `example` field)

## Testing Process
1. First verify the local server is running by checking `localhost:1200`
2. Test the route by visiting `localhost:1200/{route_path}`
3. Success: Page displays an RSS feed response
4. Failure: Investigate issues and fix the code

## Managing the Server
1. Start server: `pnpm run dev`
2. When restarting: kill the current process first, then restart
3. Wait for initialization (look for "RSSHub is running on port" in terminal output)
4. After code changes, always restart the server and test again
